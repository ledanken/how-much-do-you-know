# How Much Do You Know Website PP2<br /> <br />

### Here is the link: [How Much Do you You Know] ()<br />

### Here is the sample image ![](assets/images/howmuchdoyouknow.png)<br> <br>

#### This website is meant mainly for the learned Javascript from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net). As you can see, there is not much of html and css designs and styles. But this is another website that I would like to continue afterwards.<br>

#### I also would like to mention [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26944987/show-next-previous-item-of-an-array) for helping me with the code on Previous-Next Buttons as it took me so much time to code it with adEventListener Method and it was not running!<br>

#### This website is hoping to grow with more questions and categories in the future.<br>

### Many thanks!
